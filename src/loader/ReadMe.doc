Download both the files and include in your header file. jquery.waitingpopup.ui.js defines the loader UI and jquery.waitingpop.loader.js
defines the logic to show loader in the your application. 

Loader will be shown when either DOM gets ready or first ajax request sent or Iframe gets ready or leaving the page. 
Loader will stop when UI gets completely loaded and all ajax request complete and Iframe gets completely loaded. 

To attach for Iframe event you need to call attachIframeEvent() method after defining Iframe. No other exteral configuration
required. 

To run this application you need to use jQuery.

For downloading any sample file, loader get start but didn't get stop. To stop loader from starting on download evet, use 
follwing code:


$(window).unbind('beforeunload');

// Your Download logic

setTimeout('bindBeforeunload()', 1000);

This will unbind the leaving event of page.
